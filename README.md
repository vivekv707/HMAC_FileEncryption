# File Encryption Decryption with HMAC 
## Functions Implemented:
* File Encryption with Symmetric Key
* File Decryption
* Data Integrity Check
* Utilizes SHA-256 Hash Function

## What is Encryption?
Encryption is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.

## What is HMAC?
Hash-based message authentication code (or HMAC) is a cryptographic authentication technique that uses a hash function and a secret key. With HMAC, you can achieve authentication and verify that data is correct and authentic with shared secrets, as opposed to approaches that use signatures and asymmetric cryptography.
